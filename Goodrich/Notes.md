## Chpater 2: Object-Oriented Programming

- Design Pattern:

A pattern provides a general template for a solution that can be applied in many situations. 
It describes the **main elements** of a solution in an abstract way that can be specialized 
for a specific problem at hand. It consists of a **name**, which identifies the pattern; 
a **context**, which describes the scenarios for which this pattern can be applied; 
a **template**, which describes how the pattern is applied; 
and a **result**, which describes and analyzes what the pattern produces.
